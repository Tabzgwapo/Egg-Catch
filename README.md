# Egg-Catch
Eggs Catcher is a classic game where the goal is to catch as many eggs as possible. In this game, every egg you catch will increase your score and if you miss 3 eggs you will lose the game. Simple and relaxing! Earlier, Nokia phones had a game called "Gift". Same as this game, only the improved GUI.
